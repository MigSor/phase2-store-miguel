# Fakestore

Fakestore is a project created with React for building frontend UI components and json-server to mimic a backend server. It utilizes React, a JavaScript library, to build user interfaces with reusable components.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate the use of React in building the frontend of an e-commerce application, simulating the user interface of an online store. Additionally, it uses json-server to mimic a backend server for handling data and API requests.

**Key Features:**

-  **Zero-Coding Mock API:** Get a full fake REST API with zero coding in less than 30 seconds (seriously). Perfect for quick prototyping and mocking.

-  **Developer-Friendly:** Created with <3 for front-end developers who need a quick back-end solution for their projects.

-  **Client-Side Routing:** The project also uses `react-router-dom` for client-side routing, allowing for smooth navigation between different parts of the application.

-  **E-commerce Simulation:** Fakestore was created to mimic an e-commerce website, offering a sample selection of men's and women's clothing, jewelry, and electronics.
